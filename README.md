The purpose of the project is to help other students with the choice of worldview core courses. On this website, you can find reviews about courses,
as well as leave your own reviews. If you have already taken a course, please write your feedback to help other students with their choice.

On the main page, you can see all the active courses (according to https://ucu.edu.ua/svitoglyadne-yadro).
You can search for a course, or find it manually.
When you click on a course, its page opens. It contains information about the lecturer and the purpose of this course.

Under these two paragraphs, there is a field with all the reviews. Do not try to write profanity, because it will get censored.

We care about your confidentiality, so we collect only your profile picture, name, and email.
